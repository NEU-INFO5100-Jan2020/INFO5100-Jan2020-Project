# Things You Should Know to Create Incentives for Testing Purposes
There are two ways to create an incentive for your testing or any other purposes.
1. Using the GUI from Case5 bcreated by Group #3. **(Strongly recommend!!!)**
  * Run src/ui/guiforcase4/Main.java, input your DealerID, then you can click click click to the Create Screen.   
You can find the Lucidchart for dealer's GUI here:   
https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/75f3138b-4f63-463c-b1bc-c3d771413586/0_0?shared=true
  * You can only create incenitves for **either one vehicle or a group of vehicles**
  * All the Incentive Details (on the right side of Create Screen) are mandatory
  
2. **(Please don't do this way)** Manually adding all the details of an incentive into the database, but **you should add it in the same format like we create it**, or dealers will have problems managing their incentives.
  * The "FilterList" column in the database contains the information of all the searching filters, **it's not "null" or empty String like ""**, it's a **long String joined by six meaningful Strings from a String Array** , like "null 100 100000 Default true true"  
So, use the first approach to create incentives, or you will have to **read the code for the *"convertFilterListToString()"* method** in scr/ui/guiforcase5/CreatePage.java 
  * The *"vehicleIdList"* column in the database is an empty String like this -> ""
